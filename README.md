# CV-application-TOP-project

It wasn't a very difficult task, but it was a bit difficult because it's new code which is still not very familiar to me.
As usual, I paid more attention to functionality than design, so the application looks quite minimalistic.

What I have learned: <br>

- React and its components. Classes, events, state and props. Ways to declare methods.<br>
- And of course NPM, a little bit Git, CSS and JSX.<br>

  03.09.2022 - Due to the TOP assigment change all class components into functional components. Learn how to use some hooks (useEffect, useState)<br>
